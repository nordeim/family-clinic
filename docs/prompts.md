Don't fool yourself — today's AI coding agents are incredibly powerful and capable. They can complete even the most complex coding project in one go. The complexity of the project depends on how detailed your README, project requirements specifications and, if you have strict technical stack requirements, your project architecture design are. You can use ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude or your preferred AI chatbot to easily create these project-related specification documents.

You can also create AI-powered applications, or 'AI agents' as they are known in the industry, to automate workflows.

To celebrate the launch of their highly capable AI model and agent-based coding platform, the Chinese web-based AI coding agent is currently available to use for free at https://agent.minimax.io/ until 7 November. Take advantage of this offer to create as many AI agents as you want to automate repetitive workflows.

You can view the AI agent projects that I completed using the free web-based coding platform at the links below. Everything is done via a browser on your computer or device.

awesome understanding and meticulous planning! Yes, please meticulously proceed in phases. For each phase, please meticulously plan to create the sub-plan for the phase before proceeding according to it.


awesome job! yes, please meticulously plan and create a sub-plan for phase 4.

Awesome meticulous sub-plan for phase 4! Yes, please meticulously proceed according to your sub-plan to complete phase 4.


awesome job! Please meticulously explore how best to create a comprehensive `Project_Architecture_Document.md` in a markdown file to correctly and accurately describe the completed codebase. Include a section to describe the application architecture with a file hierarchy diagram listing key files with their description, a mermaid diagram to describe the user and application interaction, and a mermaid diagram to show the application logic flow, and a section on deployment. Try to make it an awesome, complete, and useful `Project_Architecture_Document.md` for the project. Then meticulously create a plan to create the complete updated PAD. Review and validate the plan before proceeding cautiously to execute.


awesome job! Please create a complete downloadable zip archive of the entire workspace with its sub-folders and all files so that I can upload the project to my GitHub repo. Include in the zip archive your master execution plan and sub-plans.



awesome job so far! Please think deeper and think harder to meticulously explore thoroughly and systematically how best to create a detailed, comprehensive, informative and attractive `README.md` for the GitHub repo https://github.com/nordeim/customer-support-agent.git that hosts this project. include a section to describe the application architecture with a file hierarchy diagram listing key files with their description, a mermaid diagram to describe the user and application interaction, and a mermaid diagram to show the application logic flow, and a section on deployment. Try to make it an awesome, complete, and useful `README.md` for the project. Then meticulously create a plan to create the `README.md`. Review and validate the plan before proceeding cautiously to execute.



awesome meticulous plan! yes, please meticulously proceed according to your plan.

awesome job so far! please meticulously and plan and then create a comprehensive briefing document, `CLAUDE.md`, tailored for an AI coding agent.

Act as a senior technical analyst, carefully digest the project's `README.md` and `Project_Architecture_Document.md` to produce a new, synthesized document (CLAUDE.md). The purpose of this new document is to onboard another AI coding agent like `Claude Code` or `Codex`, providing it with all the necessary context to understand the project's architecture, purpose, and operational procedures.

Steps:
1. Covering core components: project purpose, technology stack, architecture, operational commands, and development guidelines. You will reorganize and rephrase the extracted information into a new structure optimized for an AI coding agent. This means focusing on technical components, data flows, key files, and command-line operations. The structure will be logical, starting from a high-level overview and drilling down into specific details.

2. Identify Key Actionable Information: You will highlight critical information for an AI coding agent, such as environment setup, application startup commands, key file paths for modification, and API endpoints for interaction.

3. Generate `CLAUDE.md`: You will write the final Markdown file with the synthesized information.

4. Final Review: You will review the generated file to ensure it is comprehensive, accurate, and directly addresses the document's intended purpose.
